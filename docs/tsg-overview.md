## Core Concept
Self-government = the ability to determine the cause and effect of your own behavior, and to own and control your own actions. It's about internal control, not external compliance.

## The 4 Basic Skills

### 1. Following Instructions
Steps: Look at the person → Say "okay" → Do the task immediately → Check back
Why it matters: Builds the habit of responding to guidance without resistance

### 2. Accepting No Answers
Steps: Look at the person → Say "okay" → Stay calm → Drop the subject
Why it matters: Learning to handle disappointment without escalating

### 3. Accepting Criticism (Consequences)
Steps: Look at the person → Say "okay" → Don't argue → Accept the consequence
Why it matters: Taking feedback without defensiveness

### 4. Disagreeing Appropriately
Steps: Look at the person → Stay calm → Say "I understand" → Share your view calmly → Accept the outcome
Why it matters: Having a legitimate, respectful channel for disagreement

## Prerequisites (What This App Addresses)

### Calming Down
Before ANY skill can be practiced, the person must be calm. A dysregulated brain cannot learn, process, or choose.

TSG calming process:
1. Recognize you're not calm (self-awareness)
2. Use a technique to calm down (breathing, sensory grounding, etc.)
3. Assess whether you're ready to think clearly
4. Then engage with the situation

### Understanding Roles
- Parent role: teach, protect, lead, set boundaries
- Child role: learn, follow, practice, grow
- Both roles have value and purpose
- Understanding roles reduces power struggles

## How This App Connects

### Calm Station (this app)
Maps to the calming prerequisite:
- Check In → self-awareness of emotional state
- Breathe → regulation technique
- Ground → sensory reconnection to present
- Reflect → assess readiness to engage

### Future Modules
- **Roles Explorer** — interactive scenarios about family roles
- **Skill Practice** — scenario-based practice of the 4 basic skills
- **Self-Government Dashboard** — tracking progress across all skills

## Key Principles for the App

1. **Self-government is about choice, not obedience** — the app must give agency
2. **Calm first, skills second** — never try to teach during dysregulation
3. **Practice, not perfection** — celebrate the attempt, not just the result
4. **The child is learning to govern themselves** — the app is their tool, not the parent's control mechanism
5. **No shame, no punishment** — the app must never feel punitive
